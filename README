Evolve OS Package Manager
-------------------------

Fork of the PiSi Package Manager, originally from Pardus Linux,
and adapted/maintained during the lifetime of SolusOS.


NOTE: Due to talks with the "Pisilinux" project maintainers, who claim
that PiSi is being actively "maintained" (developed doesn't seem the correct
word here) this project should now be considered a FORK of the original
Pardus PiSi package manager. Note this is not a new effort, and merely
continues its life through SolusOS into Evolve OS.

In essence, it is within Evolve OS's interests to keep developing and
changing this package manager (and eventually a full rewrite) to advance
practices and improve the Evolve OS project on the whole.

Other projects will continue to use the *original* PiSi package manager,
as the aim of some of these projects is to preserve everything about their
parent project (or fork-base), which obviously would conflict with our
interests in completely rewriting it and ripping pieces out.

In time, the contents of this repository will change significantly, as
I now have total "carte blanche" to rewrite the entire package manager
in a more sensible fashion without fear of reprisal of projects not
related to Evolve OS.

The last release of this fork under the name "PiSi" will be 3.2, after
which the changes below will be initiated and a new name will be taken,
with a fresh codebase that merely integrates the original concepts, and
does away with the years of old code.

TODO:

 * COMAR will die. As will PolKit/dbus integration - It's not appropriate!!
 * The XML format and system will be ripped out - too big, too unfriendly.
 * Long run: Probable rewrite into C.
 * ACTUAL deltas. i.e. not changed files but binary diff of two packages.
 * Package signing
 * Support for VCS as Archive source (i.e. git packages)
 * Integration with SMACK (via extended attributes support)
