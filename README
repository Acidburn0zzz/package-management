Evolve OS Package Manager

Continuation of the PiSi Package Manager, originally from Pardus Linux,
and adapted/maintained during the lifetime of SolusOS.


Why the different naming?
---
Number of reasons really. Most prominent being we don't want unsupported
binary .pisi packages from Solus OS 2 (no longer going to work) or other
distributions using PiSi being installed in Evolve OS.

Basically, they'd never work properly. Whether its dependencies or the
fact we use a different toolchain... too many variables. So, we only support
Evolve OS binary packages (named .eopkg to avoid the possibility)
